This project was imagined after Facebook's stock price **dropped about 40%** between the closing on July 25, 2018 and opening of July 26, 2018. One of the main factors in the sudden drop in facebook's stock price was it's earning report missing expectations on revenue and showing a slowing user growth. This project is an attempt to help an investor keep track of big news about companies in an attempt to protect them from such a loss.
